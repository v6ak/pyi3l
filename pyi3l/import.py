# This is partially done import from the i3's layouts.
# a. Existing layouts can be read by read_objs. This ignores all the comments.
# b. New layouts can be preprocessed by this hack:
#         i3-save-tree  | (read _; sed -e 's#// split.*$##' -e 's#^\( *\)//#\1  #') | jq . --slurp
#
# Ideas for improvement:
# * we could also recognize known patterns in the regexes and generate the rest.
# * remove percent when unneeded
